This repo contains Week 8 Assignment project on Data Pipelines with Redis .

# Telecommunications Data Pipeline
This project is a data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads data from a CSV file to a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently and securely. The pipeline includes a monitoring and alerting system that sends an email notification when data is not successfully written in the PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* pandas
* psycopg2-binary
* redis
## Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom-data-pipeline.git
Install the required packages using pip

pip install pandas psycopg2-binary redis
Create a PostgreSQL database and update the database connection parameters in main.py

Update the Redis connection parameters in main.py

Usage
To run the data pipeline, run the following command:

python main.py
This will run the data pipeline, which consists of three stages:

Extract data from a CSV file and cache it in Redis
Transform the data and store it in a pandas DataFrame
Load the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database

Best Practices
This project follows several best practices for building efficient and secure data pipelines, including:

* Using Redis to cache data for faster retrieval
* Using a PostgreSQL database for secure and reliable data storage
* Using pandas for efficient data transformation
* Implementing a try-except block for error handling and alerting
* Separating configuration parameters from code
## Deployment Recommendations
To deploy this data pipeline on a cloud-based provider, consider the following recommendations:

* Use a containerization tool such as Docker to package the application and its dependencies into a single container for easy deployment and management.
* Use a container orchestration tool such as Kubernetes to automate deployment, scaling, and management of the containerized application.
* Use a cloud-based PostgreSQL and Redis service such as AWS RDS or Azure Cache for Redis to simplify database setup and management.
* Use a cloud-based email service such as Amazon SES or SendGrid to send email notifications.
